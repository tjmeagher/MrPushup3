            <p>When I get older, I want to start a career in financing and business. Specifically, I want to play with the stock market and get involved with trading stocks.  To achieve my goal, I will continue to take more of the engineering classes that Dublin High School offers and continue to make the most out of the engineering academy. Also, I will take business classes, like Integrated Marketing and Economics of Business Ownership, and join DECA to better prepare me for my career. After graduating with my Engineering Diploma, I will go to New York University to study Finance. This is my personal career choice because my dad buys and sells stocks himself, and he teaches me about the certain things involved around that business and how much potential money you could earn if you know what you're doing. By being apart of the engineering academy, I am able to learn a lot about the engineering and technology industry and use that knowledge to invest in companies that I think will do good in the future. </p>
            <p>Some characterstics that I have are persistence and adaptability. For example, at the beginning of my Junior year of high school I was not focused on my school work and was distracted with other conflicts with my friends. My grades began to drop down and I was far from the goals that I set for myself at the beginning of the year. Instead of accepting the situation, I worked hard and made sure to study before school, lunch, and after school to bring up my grades. After a month of that same process, my grades got back up to where I wanted because of my persistence. Another characteristic that I have is adaptability. Being a student athlete, I don't have a lot of time for other activities, so I have to be adaptable and have good time management skills. For example, last year as a Sophomore I expected to have all weekend to study for my finals. But, an unexpected tournament came up for basketball that weekend, and I had no time to study over the weekend. Therefore I adapted and managed my time to study for an hour every night so that the next week, I was able to be fully prepared while also going to my tournament. One accomplishment that I am proud of, is that I have received a Dublin High School student-athlete patch for my Sophomore year of high school. I am glad that I received this award because it showed that all of my hard work had paid off. This award was given to me because I was a Varsity athlete while also maintaining a 3.5 grade point average. Sophomore year was a much more challenging year for me academically and for me to be able to manage my time and still be able to keep my grades up shows my commitment and dedication. Taking difficult classes has showed me that I have the skills of problem solving. When taking advanced classes, answers are not obviously found, but instead you need to think outside of the box and analyze multiple different perspectives. Solving problems is a major skill in the working field as there are many obstacles, whether it be incorrect code or a faulty mechanism, that require you to think. </p>
            <p>Ever since I was young, I'd wanted to pursue a career in business. Some traits that will help me achieve my career is that I am persistent, dedicated, and I am a problem solver. Feel free to look around my website some more and even check out some of the projects that I have worked on. I want to thank you for reading this page and taking time out of your day to learn about me. </p>
