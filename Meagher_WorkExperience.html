            <p> Throughout my highschool career, I've been searching for a career that best suits me. I've been exploring with
                courses that I might be interested in and might pursue in the future. As a freshman, I took the Computer Science
                Engineering course because one of my hobbies was video games and Computer Science involved working with computers.
                But after taking the course, I knew it wasn't for me. Sitting all day in a computer lab writing lines of code wasn't
                very appealing. When choosing classes for the following year, I looked at the course Principles of Engineering and 
                thought how interesting the class could be for me. I asked a few of my friends who took the class that year and they
                all seemed to enjoy it. What interested me about Principles of Engineering was that it didn't focus on one specific
                type of engineering. Throughout the year, we focused on all types of engineering from structural to electrical to even
                computer engineering. My junior year, I decided to take Digital Electronics. I decided to take this class because,
                from my experience in Principles of Engineering, the electical engineering units were most interesting to me. 
                From this, I knew that I wanted to take Digital Electronics.</p>
            <p> While in Principles of Engineering and Digital Electronics, every month or so, we would have a guest speaker in to talk about their 
                profession. There would be many different interesting people coming to talk about what they did and how they performed
                their jobs. Well, one person that really stuck out to me my Sophomore year was Aaron Pomerantz. He was an entomologist 
                but not only was he an entomologist, he was also a field biologist. This specific guest speaker stuck out to me 
                because he was relatable, he was just like me. When he was in college and looking for a field of study, he made 
                sure that 1) it was within his interests and 2) was interactive. This guest speaker talked about how he couldn't 
                stay in labs all day and wanted to go around and explore. He would study insects and would regularly find himself out in 
                nature interacting with the environment and habitat. This guest speaker was influential because being a field biologist 
                never really crossed my mind. But after listening to his presentation, I realized that working out in the field and
                actually interacting with things was perfect for me. One guest speaker that stuck out to me was Jason Yosinski. He is 
                a scientist who was researching about neural networks through deep visualization. This was, by far, the most interesting 
                guest speaker that I've had in the past two years. He introduced us with talking about his recent research regarding visualizing
                neurons and giving us background learning of the differences between artificial intelligence and machine learning. 
                Artificial intelligence is a robots' capability to have any sense of intelligence or human action. Machine Learning is when 
                computer systems use algorithms and patterns to solve certain task without explicit instructions. From there, he dives in deeper
                of visualizing neurons from all layers and using a deep visualization toolbox. From the visualizations and the toolbox, we 
                learned that systems recognize facial features without us telling them to because it helps them with other tasks. The thing
                that I found most interesting was that, initially, they thought that the deep neural network would recognize objects based
                on one or two key features. But what they found out was that objects take in a whole lot more information about objects than
                we thought. The interactive presentation, along with my curiosity, made this one of the more interesting guest speaker presentations. </p>
            <p> Also, while in Principles of Engineering and Digital Electronics, every once and a while, we are given the opportunity to go on field trips to 
                different companies that focus on some sort of Engineering. One place that I went to was Cal Maritime Academy and SunPower.
                From this field trip, I found that many things were of interest to me. At Cal Maritime, students would work on one big 
                ship. This ship was student-run meaning that no adults or professors were interfering with the ship. This very much interested
                me because as I stated before, I like being interactive and hands-on with my work. This project at Cal Maritime with the ship 
                fits in perfectly with these character traits that I have. If I were to go there, I could first-hand know how to work on a ship and
                deal with real life problems that occur while working in the field of engineering. Also, I like how no adults interfere with 
                the work on the ship because it makes the students accountable to make sure the ship is still running. Lastly when we went to 
                SunPower, I found it interesting dealing with solar energy. Especially in today's world, looking for efficient forms of energy 
                is vital in making sure that our world keeps evolving and developing. One of these ways is with solar power. Solar energy comes 
                straight from the sun so as long as the sun is still here, there will always be solar energy. This interested me because
                working with real-life problems is something that I always find interesting whether its volunteering at a food bank or picking up 
                trash at the beach. There will always be problems in our environment, and sources of energy is something that I could explore interests in when choosing
                my career. Another field trip that I went on that peaked my interests was the field trip to BART and to Workday. It was interesting
                to see and hear from all of the employees that worked at both BART and Workday. I've rode on BART many times and I never really
                put much thought into all that goes on behind the scenes with BART. Similar to BART, I've driven past Workday on the freeway 
                many times before, and I never stopped to think about what exactly Workday does. I found it very interesting talking to all of the 
                BART employees because there was a wide diversity of employees. For example, there were senior mechanical engineers and there
                were civil engineers that were fresh out of college, so just talking to the different positions gave me different perspectives
                on what they do on a daily basis. The most important thing that I took away from the field trip to BART was not regarding 
                what they do, specifically for BART, but there journey to their position at BART. A group of people, myself included, were
                talking to a mechanical engineer who first started working there a year prior. Before that, he went to college at Sacremento State.
                He talked about the importance of doing internships and also told us an important thing about college in general. He told us his salary
                and he was making upwards of $80,000 dollars a year straight out of college. The important thing he told us about college
                is that the name of the school isn't of high importance when looking for a job. He explained how he went to Sacremento State
                and became a mechanical engineer and is now in a great position for his future. He told us that we shouldn't worry so much 
                about where we go to for college, but instead worry about what your going to do in college. If you actively seek out internships
                and you show other people that you want to learn, then professors and other people will want to put you in the best position
                to succeed. While at Workday, we got to listen to a group of programmers as they hosted a Q&A panel. Similar to BART, it was interesting
                to hear about their day-to-day life and to hear about all of the different tasks that go into Workday.</p>
            <p> While in the Engineering Academy, we were assigned a mentor. These mentors would use their personal experiences with college and with their jobs
                and share them with us. My mentor was Andrew Thurber. Andrew Thurber is a mechanical and structural analyst who works at Lawrence
                Livermore National Laboratory. For the past year,  I've been learning everything with how to properly apply for a job to the process
                of college applications. The most important thing that my mentor has taught me has to do with internships in college. He told me 
                that you should not intern somewhere just to put it into your resume or just to stat pad your resume. When applying for jobs,
                companies will see right through your resume and see that you are padding your resume. Instead, you should either get an internship
                that interests you and you want to try or one that will benefit you in your future. What he meant by the latter is that you should
                get an internship so that it can possibly put you into a better position to get a job at that same company, or get an internship
                that is very similar to the position you want out of college, so that you can show companies, "Hey, I did an internship at this
                company that perfectly fits the position you and I are both looking for." My mentor has taught me other things regarding the 
                structuring of my resume and how to look and sound my best in interviews, as well. The mentorship program was an amazing experience  
                where I learned many traits and attributes that will help me in my future.
