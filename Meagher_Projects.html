            <h3>Project: MIT AppInventor Project</h3>
            <h3>Project Name: GeoGuesser</h3>
            <h3>Duration: September 19th - October 6th 2017</h3>
            <h3>Course: Computer Science/Software Engineering</h3>
            <p>The objective of this project was to make a game using MIT AppInventor. 
            My partner and I created a game where you would study a map of a location 
            and answer questions that would relate to the map. As a team, each day we 
            would assign a task to complete for the night. During the first week of the 
            project, I was the one who was in charge of the project notebook. During the 
            second week of the project, I would expand on our code and add more questions 
            to our game. Throughout the process of making the game, our team ran into 
            some obstacles. One obstacle we ran into was we did not know how to flip 
            screens from the map to the question. We tried many different methods 
            from shaking, to using a button, and using a timer, but we finally figured 
            out a solution. Instead of adding anything to the game, we used the back 
            button on the bottom bezel of the tablet. From this experience, we learned 
            that when a code is not working the way we want, do not give up on your idea. 
            We learned to think of different ways to solve the solution and to think 
            outside the box. You can look at our project notebook at 
            this <a class="link" target="_blank" href=" ProjectNotebook.pdf">link.</a></p>

            <h3>Project Name: Colgato Ltd. Branding</h3>
            <h3>Duration: March 6th - March 25th 2018</h3>
            <h3>Course: Computer Science/Software Engineering</h3>
            <p>The objective of this project was to create a program for a company. 
            My partner and I created a program where it pastes human teeth, a logo, 
            motto, and a border onto a list of different cat images. Each day we would 
            try to improve on editing our images. Each day we progressed and progressed 
            until our final product was completely finished. Throughout the two weeks, we 
            each worked on the project with good chemistry. During the project we ran into 
            a few hiccups. We could not figure out how to make the lips transparent. After a 
            couple of days, we figured it out, we had to set a mask equal to the background. But other than that
            our teamwork was stellar and we didn't run into many problems. This was our third project 
            together as partners and our teamwork keeps on getting better and better. Together on this 
            project, we learned to work together better, and to manage our time, so we can get our program done on time 
            with no hassle.

            <h3>Project: 1.3.2 Project</h3>
            <h3>Project Name: Solar Hydrogen Vehicle</h3>
            <h3>Duration: October 31st - November 16th 2018</h3>
            <h3>Course: Principles of Engineering</h3>
            <p>The objective of this project was to design a vehicle from scratch. This vehicle 
            had to work under different power source configurations that include solar and hydrogen
            cells. As a team, each day we would assign jobs to different people in the group
            so we could finish our project on time. If someone were to have a bigger role for the
            group one day, the next day they would let others take lead. We did this, so each person 
            in the group was able to experience and work on different parts of the project and to make
            sure everyone did the same amount of work. Throughout the beginning stages of our project, 
            we had to brainstorm and construct our vehicle. For my job throughout the first week, I 
            had to create a series circuit for two hydrogen cells and had to think of ways to stabilize
            our breadboard and our power sources to our vehicle. As well as those specific jobs, I helped 
            construct and build our vehicle. Once we finished constructing our vehicle, we had to test
            and make sure our vehicle was running in the second week. During this time, my job was to charge 
            the hydrogen cells for testing and brainstorming ideas with our gear ratios, whether it be with
            our chain and sprocket system or our gears to make our vehicle run faster and smoother. From this 
            project, we learned to manage our time efficiently and to focus on a plan and run with it. Instead
            of questioning our design from our brainstorming sessions, we focused on one idea and made sure to 
            work with it and roll with it. Also we learned to manage our time efficiently by assigning roles
            each day of equal work to get our project done on time.

            <h3>Project: 2.3.2 Project</h3>
            <h3>Project Name: West Point Bridge Desgin</h3>
            <h3>Duration: March 7th - March 18th 2019</h3>
            <h3>Course: Principles of Engineering</h3>
            <p>The objective of this project was to create cost-effective, stable bridge that spans the 
               length of the Trinity River to allow people and trucks to cross. My partner and I created
               four bridge designs that would meet the constraints of the project. Some of these constraints 
               included the cost must be under $300,000, the bridge deck elevation must be between 12 and 24 meters,
               and members had to be made of carbon steel, high-strength low alloy steel, or quenched and tempered
               steel. Everyday we would add or improve to our two bridge designs to fit these constraints while
               also being stable. Once we completed our four bridge designs, we decided on further improving on only
               one of those. Together, we would add improvements to make the most stable bridge while keeping the cost
               under the given amount. My job throughout the project varied. For the first week of the project, I was 
               working on and creating two bridge designs, while my partner worked on two designs himself. From there 
               we decided on one of my partners designs. When this happened, he mainly made modifications to the design 
               while I would add some improvements as well. But my main job during this time, was to keep up with the 
               documentation. If you would like to view the documentation, click this <a class="link" target="_blank" href=" 
               ProjectNotebook4.pdf">link.</a> In the documentation, I focused on writing the description for the brainstorm
               sketches, the design brief, and any other task related to the documentation. From this project, I learned how
               to work efficiently during a limited amount of time. We only had eleven days to finish this project and each day 
               we had to focus to not waste any time. Being given the same task as my partner in creating two bridge designs, also 
               helped me be accountable. My partner was there to make sure I was doing my work, while I was making sure he was
               doing his. This project helped further my knowledge in structural engineering and skills with working as a team.

            <h3>Project: PCB Design </h3>
            <h3>Project Name: Electronic Piano</h3>
            <h3>Duration: October 7th - October 26th 2019</h3>
            <h3>Course: Digital Electronics</h3>
            <p>The objective of this project was to create my very own Printed Circuit Board from scratch. 
            This was my very first engineering project done individually, so I had to hold myself accountable each
            and every day. For this project, I created an electronic keyboard by using multiple resistors, capacitors, 
            and button switches to create different frequencies and simulate piano keys. Each day, I assigned specific
            goals for me to accomplish before class ended to make sure that my time was correctly managed. For the first week
            of the project, I had to create the circuit and display it on my breadboard. Once I finished creating a working
            breadboard circuit, I made a fritzing diagram for the different connections that were going to be on my PCB. Next,
            I had to actually create the physical board for my PCB, as I had to go through the masking and etching process. Once
            I completed those steps, I finally finished my board by drilling and soldering on the components of my circuit. Throughout
            the project, I had two major obstacles that I had to overcome. The first challenge I had to overcome was during the 
            masking process. I had accidentally wiped off my whole circuit with acetone. Instead of worrying, I remained 
            calm and redid the whole process, while making sure I was managing my time correctly. Another challenge I had to overcome
            was that I forgot to fritz holes for my battery pack. I noticed this late into my project process as I was ready to drill 
            and solder my components. Without the battery pack, I would be unable to power my circuit. I remained calm, and I talked to
            my teacher to see what I should do to fix the problem. We worked out the problem by drilling holes in connections already
            on my board. During this project, I learned how to keep myself in check and to problem solve when things don't go my way.

            <h3>Project: 2.3.5 Project </h3>
            <h3>Project Name: PLD Design</h3>
            <h3>Duration: February 25th - March 2nd 2020</h3>
            <h3>Course: Digital Electronics</h3>
            <p>The objective of this project was to create a message on a seven-segment display using a programmable logic device. 
            This was my second engineering project done individually, so I knew how to create a work schedule and come in everyday trying to accomplish a task. 
            For this project, I had to build individual circuits and then combine them together. From there, I would have to transfer the circuits onto my PLD and wire it on my breadboard.
            As I stated before, each day, I assigned specific tasks for me to accomplish before class ended to make sure that I was working efficiently and effectively. 
            For the first week of the project, I had to brainstorm a message, "Friends Don't Lie" and create a truth table corresponding to that message. 
            Once I finished the truth table, I had to simplify expressions for segments A-F. Next,
            I had to use the simplified expressions to build separate Multisim circuits for segments A-F, as I used logic gates to match the expressions. Once
            I completed those steps, I wired these individual circuits to their respected outputs and I transferred this into the programmable logic device. Throughout
            the project, I had one major obstacle that I had to overcome. The major obstacle I had to overcome was time management.
            I had been sick for the the week before we started this project, and I was catching up on missed assignments. So, when I finally was
            able to start my project I was two days behind. Instead of worrying, I remained calm and created a work schedule. This schedule helped me organize
            my thoughts and make sure that I was using my time wisely. I used my time management skills from my previous project and used
            it to make a bad situation better. Instead of rushing through the project, I made sure that I did not procrastinate and that I held 
            myself accountable. During this project, I learned how to hold myself accountable and to step back and analyze a situation. I saw that I was two days
            late starting on a project, and instead of worrying and rushing, I took a step back, created a plan, and executed on that plan.
